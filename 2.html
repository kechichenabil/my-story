        <h2><u>What is inguinal hernia?</u></h2>
      </legend>
      <p>
        <mark>An inguinal hernia</mark> occurs when part of the lining of the abdominal cavity (omentum) or intestine
        protrudes through a weak spot in the abdomen — usually along the inguinal canal, which carries the spermatic
        cord
        in men. An inguinal hernia isn't necessarily dangerous. However, it doesn't get better on its own, <mark>and it
          can lead to life-threatening complications if you don't have surgery.</mark>

      <h3><u>My story</u></h3>
      <p>
        **"I thought I could never stop, but little did I know, I was about to face a disaster I couldn't escape
        from."**
        <br>

        <mark>My story</mark> began on a seemingly ordinary day when I was helping our neighbor carry some heavy tools
        into his house. Hours passed quickly as I lifted the weights, moving from room to room, and I thought I could
        handle anything. But what I didn't realize at that moment was that I was putting myself in far greater danger
        than
        I could have ever imagined. In a moment of innocent arrogance, I believed my body had no limits, that I could
        bear
        any strain. But I was wrong.

        Once I finished the task, I returned home to rest, but my body was refusing to surrender. I was exhausted, yet I
        couldn’t stop. Then, I received a call from my friend inviting me to play football. **"Come on, Nabil, let's
        play
        like we’ve never played before!"** I couldn’t resist the excitement that surged through me, even though my body
        screamed for rest. Deep inside, I knew I would pay the price for this moment later, but I couldn’t back out.

        **On the field, everything felt like an action movie, everything spinning around me at a fast pace, but I didn’t
        realize I was living the last moment that would change everything.**
        <br>

        I jumped high, passed the ball, and in an unexpected instant, I fell awkwardly to the ground. A strange
        sensation
        coursed through my body, as if I could hear something inside me screaming that something was wrong. **Suddenly,
        I
        realized that I was no longer the same, and my body was betraying me.** My face went pale, and a single question
        echoed in my mind: "Is this the pain I had been running from all my life?"

        A few minutes passed, but I had suffered something far worse than I could have imagined. When I looked at my
        body,
        I saw a strange bulge in my lower abdomen. I didn’t know then that I had injured myself with something called an
        "inguinal hernia." At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I was young, how could anything disrupt my life?

        **But three days later, came the moment that made me realize I was in real danger.**
        <br>

        While scrolling through Facebook, a post appeared discussing symptoms very similar to what I was feeling in my
        groin area. It mentioned the need for surgery to address the hernia. **My hands began to tremble as I read about
        the symptoms, and one of them mentioned that the only treatment for this condition was surgery!** At that
        moment,
        it felt like the ground had shifted beneath me. Was I going to need surgery? Was this the price I had to pay for
        my neglect?

        That was when I started thinking seriously. I realized it was time to take responsibility for my body, which I
        had
        believed was invincible. I learned that an inguinal hernia is not just a minor health issue—it’s a crisis that
        can
        impact your whole life. **Three years have passed since that moment, and I’ve lived in constant fear, living
        between hope and the unknown, wondering if I would ever overcome this experience without paying the high cost.**

        **Today, as I write these words, I reflect on the lessons I’ve learned.** In the beginning, I thought life
        always
        gives you another chance to correct your mistakes, but now I know that some decisions cannot be undone. Yes, I
        made a mistake by neglecting my body, but I learned that health is the most precious thing we have. When you pay
        the price, there’s no turning back. Nothing in life is worth more than your health.

        **Take care of your body, because you may think you're invincible, but life may surprise you in a moment you
        never
        saw coming, forcing you to face a reality you can’t escape.**

        ---

        **Conclusion:**
        To everyone who thinks youth is invincible or that life will always favor you: **the truth is far more complex
        than that.** I’ve learned that health isn’t just about the absence of illness—it’s about being aware of those
        little moments that can turn into bigger problems. Today, I can proudly say I’ve learned to never take my body
        for
        granted, because life doesn’t wait for anyone.

      <h3>
        <u> Operation day</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <mark>"I was on the verge of fear, but I discovered that the hardest part was just the waiting."</mark>
        <br>
        On the day of the operation, I felt something indescribable – a mix of fear and anticipation. My feet felt as if
        they were glued to the ground, unable to move because of the overwhelming anxiety. But as soon as I handed over
        my
        medical file, everything started to change. The medical team greeted me with warmth and care, and suddenly I
        felt
        like I was in safe hands.
        <br>
        Then I entered the waiting room… Time seemed to move so slowly, but I wasn't alone. The team was ready, prepared
        to guide me through every step of the process. Shortly after, the doctor came in, flashing a reassuring smile,
        and
        handed me the hospital gown. He said, "Everything will be fine. Don’t worry."
        <br>
        At that moment, a sense of calm started to wash over me. The medical team spoke kindly to me, explaining
        everything step by step to ease my anxiety. The doctor assured me, "You’re in good hands. This is a routine
        procedure, and we’ll take care of everything."
        <br>
        Then… came the needle. It wasn't at all like I had imagined. It was almost like a magical moment. The instant
        the
        sedative was injected into my vein, everything began to fade. Suddenly, I started seeing strange, wave-like
        patterns… and in the blink of an eye, I lost consciousness.
        <br>
        And then... <b>I woke up</b>. In the blink of an eye, all those long moments of fear and worry had vanished, and
        to my surprise, I felt nothing! No pain, no discomfort—just a sense of peace as if I had been sleeping in a
        quiet
        place, far from any stress or fear.
        <br>
        A few hours later, the doctor came to reassure me: "The surgery was a complete success, and everything is fine.
        We've placed a mesh around the torn area to strengthen the abdominal muscles." These words were like a light
        piercing through the darkness of my anxiety.
        <br>
        I couldn’t believe it—<b>I didn’t feel any pain</b> during recovery. <b>Nothing was like I had imagined</b>. In
        the days following the surgery, I felt like I had started a new life—free from the pain I had feared.
        <br>
        What I want to tell everyone reading my story is this: <b>"Fear before the surgery is the only real enemy."</b>
        Because when you're in the hands of a professional medical team, you'll feel safe and secure. And in the end,
        you’ll discover that what you were afraid of was nothing like you thought.
        <br>
        If you have any fear about undergoing a surgery, remember this: medical advancements today have made surgeries
        safer and easier. <b>Don’t let fear hold you back, because the results will amaze you.</b>

      <h4><u>Risks of not having the procedure done</u></h4>
      <p>
        If you are unable to push the inguinal hernia back in, the contents of the inguinal hernia may become trapped
        (incarcerated) within the abdominal wall.<mark>The inguinal hernia can become strangulated, which cuts off
          blood</mark> , flow to the trapped tissue. <mark>An inguinal hernia can be life-threatening if left
          untreated.</mark>
